# portfolio-site
A GitHub Pages site built for showcasing enhanced academic project artifacts and other info

<!--
## ToDo:
- Code Review Video
- Original and enhanced artifacts
- Narratives addressing implemented enhancements/skills demonstrated/specific course outcomes
- Professional self assessment (first thing presented)

### Notes:
- Emphasizes specialization/skills within it wherever possible.
- Clear, navigable, logical pages to present work
- make content "visible", so it doesnt have to be downloaded
- Explain approach to problem, steps taken to solve it, and results achieved
