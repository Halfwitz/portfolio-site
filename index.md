## Professional Self Assessment

## **About Me**

A Computer Science student nearing graduation for my Bachelors program at Southern New Hampshire University, dedicated to continually expanding and improving my skills and Software Development.

## **My Recently Improved Projects**

I've recently had the opportunity in the final Capstone course of my Computer Science program to reflect on previously completed course projects,
identify, and improve aspects of the them that I feel should better demonstrate my software development skills and prove my dedication to continuosly improving myself and my work.

### Code Review

To learn more about the projects I've enhanced, you can watch the code review I've conducted prior to enhancement walking through each aspect of the code for both artifacts. In the video, I identify areas of improvement and describe enhancement plans to improve each area and transform my project to the next level.

*(42 Minutes, recorded Jan. 19, 2025)* 

In conducting this video as my first code review, I've learned through the analysis and explanation of my existing code the importance of being able to identify weaknesses within the structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, or security and contemplate logical solutions to these issues.
