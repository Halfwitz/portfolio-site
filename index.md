## About Me
A Computer Science student nearing graduation for my Bachelors program at Southern New Hampshire University, dedicated to continually expanding and improving my skills and Software Development.

## My Recently Improved Projects
I've recently had the opportunity in the final Capstone course of my Computer Science program to reflect on previously completed course projects,
identify, and improve aspects of the them that I feel should better demonstrate my software development skills and prove my dedication to continuosly improving myself and my work.

### Code Review
To learn more about the projects I've enhanced, you can watch the code review I've conducted walking through each aspect of the code, identifying areas of improvements and describing enhancements to improve each area and transform my project to the next level.

### DayPlanner - A contact, task, and appointment management system enhanced with an interactive GUI and efficient search capabilities.

### Inventory Tracker - An Android Mobile Application designed for managing inventory items, with functionality for adding, removing, and editing inventory and receiving SMS alerts for items reaching 0 stock.
